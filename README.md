# Team Unknown6 [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)]

From the _**4th August 00:49 GMT +1**_ till _**07/08/2016 - 01:05 GMT +1**_, something amazing happened.
A community of PokemonGO players from all around the world, got together with the sole purpose of re-opening up Niantic's API.

We were collectively known as **Team Unknown6** and what followed for the duration of those 3 and a half days was nothing short of special and unforgettable.

It was a multi-day, multi-person effort to decrypt the U6 generation algorithm, and was organized through the PokemonGoDev subreddit (and livechat) as well as associated discord chat, and multiple wiki, and github repositories.

Niantic closed off it's API's in retaliation to botters but the API had other major uses, such as building maps, inventory management, mass management of Pokémon and a whole plethora of other very useful tools.
And to date, we cannot think of one major PokémonGO community that wasn't built off the back of accessing the API directly from Niantic servers.

Niantic and others need to look at why the community is resorting to such methods in the first place.
Personally speaking, if a community had such a strong desire that they came together to work on a joint effort like this, we'd answer them head on.
It's not every day that you see a fanbase as passionate as this, unify so quickly on one point to take action.

This is a testament to how much potential the game has, and personally, we feel Niantic Inc. is not making full use of this potential and are dragging their feet with it.
In short, Niantic, create a set of safe API's, whitelist people and work with the community to build an application ecosystem.
Otherwise, you're going to be left with not just a broken game, but with a broken community as well.
